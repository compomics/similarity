## Scoring functions 

This project contains scoring functions on comparing an acquired MS/MS spectrum against

- a theoretical spectrum 

     --  Andromeda-like scoring (probabilistic)

     -- Sequest-like scoring (non-probabilistic)
      
- an acquired spectrum 

    -- Dot product
    
    -- Normalized dot product
    
    -- Pearson's r
    
    -- Spearman's rho
    
    -- Probabilistic based (including peak intensities)
