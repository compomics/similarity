## The scoring functions 

This project contains the scoring functions to compare an acquired MS/MS spectrum against

- a theoretical spectrum via

     --  Andromeda-like scoring (probabilistic)

     -- Sequest-like scoring (non-probabilistic)
      
- another acquired spectrum via

    -- Dot product
    
    -- Normalized dot product
    
    -- Pearson's r
    
    -- Spearman's rho
    
    -- Probabilistic based (including peak intensities)
