# Project description

The scoring functions to assess spectrum similarity play a crucial role in many computational mass spectrometry algorithms. These scoring functions can be used to compare an acquired MS/MS spectrum against two different types of target spectra: either against a theoretical MS/MS spectrum derived from a peptide from a sequence database, or against another, previously acquired acquired MS/MS spectrum. The former is typically encountered in database searching, while the latter is used in spectrum clustering, spectral library searching, or the detection of unique spectra between different data sets in comparative proteomics studies. 

The most commonly used scoring functions in experimental versus theoretical spectrum matching could be divided into two groups:

- non-probabilistic (cross correlations which was used for [SEQUEST](http://fields.scripps.edu/sequest/))
- probabilistic (cumulative binomial probability derived scoring functions in [Andromeda](http://141.61.102.17/maxquant_doku/doku.php?id=maxquant:andromeda) and [MS Amanda](http://ms.imp.ac.at/?goto=msamanda))
 
 
Scoring functions for the comparison of two experimental spectra:
- Normalized dot product (most commonly used in spectrum library search algorithms such as [SpectraST](http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:SpectraST), [BiblioSpec](https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/BiblioSpec/begin.view)
- Pearsonâ€™s and Spearman's correlation coefficients

# Avaliable scoring functios
This project contains the enlisted scoring functions in [Project description](## Project description). The scoring functions  are in order to compare an acquired MS/MS spectrum against:

- a theoretical spectrum via
 - SEQUEST-like scoring function (non-probabilistic)
 - Andromeda-like scoring function (probabilistic)

- another acquired spectrum via
 - Dot product
 - Normalized dot product
 - Normalized dot product with introducting weights from peak intensities 
 - Pearson's r
 - Spearman's rho
 - Mean Squared Error (MSE) (and also root MSE)
 - Median Squared Error (MdSE) (and also root MdSE)
 - Probabilistic scoring functon (including peak intensities)

The scoring functions enlisted here were used to evaluate their ability to assess spectrum similarity on a book chapter by evaluating one of the CPTAC data sets. The settings are on the bookChapter.properties.

### Differential pipeline

Moreover, the implemented scoring functions could be used to compare two experimental data sets in a comparative pipeline. A stand-alone program can be downloaded [here](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/com/compomics/scoring_pipeline/0.1/scoring_pipeline-0.1.zip). Input files and parameters can be set on MS2Similatiry.properties file. The GUI version of this stand-alone program can be downloaded [here](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/com/compomics/scoring_pipeline/1.0/scoring_pipeline-1.0.zip). 


### A pairwise spectrum comparison GUI
This GUI enables the manual inspection how spectra actually look alike with corresponding to similarity score and can be downloaded [here](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/com/compomics/spectrum_similarity_pairwise_GUI/0.1/spectrum_similarity_pairwise_GUI-0.1.zip).

### Book chapter
The program to compare spectra with the avaliable scoring functions, against either theoretical or experimental spectra can be downloaded [here](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/com/compomics/spectrum_similarity/0.1/spectrum_similarity-0.1.zip).
The settings to perform spectrum comparison are on the bookChapter.properties file.
